title: "FRI - Feature Relevance Intervals for Interpretable and Interactive Data
Exploration"
event: CIBCB19
event_url: https://cibcb2019.icas.xyz/
location: Certosa di Pontignano, Siena - Tuscany, Italy
summary: 
abstract: >
  Most existing feature selection methods are insufficient for analytic purposes as soon as high dimensional data or redundant sensor signals are dealt with since features can be selected due to spurious effects or correlations rather than causal effects.
  To support the finding of causal features in biomedical experiments, we hereby present FRI, an open source Python library that can be used to identify all-relevant variables in linear classification and (ordinal) regression problems.
  Using the recently proposed feature relevance interval method, FRI is able to provide the base for further general experimentation or in specific can facilitate the search for alternative biomarkers.
  It can be used in an interactive context, by providing model manipulation and visualization methods, or in a batch process as a filter method.
