## Usage Data

This website does not collect personal data from visitors.

We use a third-party [visitor counting script](https://goatcounter.com) which saves the number of page views without identifying user behaviour or any other user information.
Check their privacy policy [here](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy) to see exactly what is stored.

The website is served by [Netlify CDN](https://www.netlify.com/) which is probably collecting similar anonymous access data for usage statistics.

## Comments

We utilize the [Commento](https://commento.io/) commenting plugin which is hosted on our own server in Germany.
Commento allows anonymous comments as well as logging in via e-mail or third-party _OAuth_ providers (Google, GitHub).
By logging in you agree that your identifying information (e-mail address, name) is stored and a Cookie is installed to save the login state in the current browser.
Additionally, Commento uses [Akismet](https://akismet.com/privacy/) as a spam detection service.
